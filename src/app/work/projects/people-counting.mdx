## Overview

Do you know how people *actually* move through and utilize your buildings, public spaces, or retail environments? Understanding footfall, occupancy levels, and flow patterns is crucial for efficiency and planning, but manual tracking is impractical and inaccurate. We provide **advanced IoT-based people counting systems** using reliable technologies like **PAX counters and Infrared (IR) sensors**. Our solutions deliver anonymous, real-time data on how your facilities or infrastructure are being used, empowering businesses and cities to make informed decisions while upholding **strict privacy standards**. See your data come alive on a **customizable dashboard, complete with map visualizations** showing usage across different zones or locations.

## Key Features

-   **Accurate People Counting:** Employs state-of-the-art **PAX counters and/or IR sensors** for high-accuracy detection of people entering, exiting, or occupying specific areas.
-   **Privacy-Focused by Design:** Systems count anonymously, collecting **no personally identifiable information (PII)**, ensuring compliance and public trust. Data integrity is paramount.
-   **Real-Time Occupancy Insights:** Access live data on current occupancy levels, peak times, and foot traffic trends for individual zones or entire facilities.
-   **Intuitive Dashboard & Map Visualization:** View aggregated data clearly presented on a web-based dashboard. **Visualize activity hotspots and flow patterns directly on a floor plan or geographical map.**
-   **Understand Usage Patterns:** Analyze historical data to identify trends, optimize layouts, allocate resources (like staffing or cleaning schedules), and improve visitor/employee experiences.
-   **Scalable IoT Platform:** Our solution can easily scale from monitoring a single entrance to covering large, complex facilities or multiple locations across a city.
-   **Data Integration (Optional):** Combine people counting data with other relevant sources (e.g., sales data, event schedules) for deeper contextual insights.

## How It Works 

-   **Sensor Deployment:** We strategically install unobtrusive **PAX counters or IR sensors** at key entry/exit points or within defined zones based on your specific needs and facility layout.
-   **Anonymous Data Capture:** Sensors detect human presence and movement, generating anonymous count data (e.g., entries, exits, dwell time). **No images or identifying features are stored.**
-   **Secure Data Transmission:** Count data is securely transmitted via IoT networks to our central platform for processing and analysis.
-   **Data Aggregation & Visualization:** The platform aggregates the anonymous data, calculating occupancy, flow rates, and other metrics. This information is then displayed on your **
