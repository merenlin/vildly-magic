## Overview

We offer a comprehensive solution for **your business**, whether you are **property owners** or in the **manufacturing industry**, wanting to gain full control over your energy usage and identify concrete opportunities for savings. By combining the right sensor technology with powerful visualization and data integrations, we provide the tools you need to actively lower your energy costs and optimize operations.

## What We Do

-   **Sensor Selection and Delivery:** We help you select and deliver the sensors needed to effectively measure **your** electricity consumption â€“ from the overall property level down to specific machines or processes within the industry.
-   **Custom Dashboards:** We build clear and easy-to-understand web-based dashboards where **you** can follow **your** energy usage in real-time, view historical trends, and quickly detect anomalies or potential efficiencies.
-   **API Integrations:** To provide deeper insights, we connect **your** consumption data with external data sources. This can include weather forecasts (to understand heating/cooling needs) and current electricity prices (spot prices, e.g., from Nord Pool) to optimize when **you** use electricity.
-   **Data Control and Analysis:** **You** gain full ownership and access to **your** collected data. We assist in setting up the system so that **you** can analyze the information yourselves and make informed decisions to reduce consumption and costs.

## Technologies and Tools (Examples)

-   **Sensor Technology:** Modern and reliable energy and power sensors (both wired and wireless options).
-   **Data Collection:** Robust platforms for collecting and storing time-series data from sensors.
-   **Visualization:** Flexible tools for dashboards, e.g., Grafana, or custom web applications.
-   **Integrations:** Standardized API connections to retrieve external data (weather, electricity prices, etc.).

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing effective energy monitoring involves more than just technology. A common challenge is identifying *where* and *what* is most valuable to measure to gain maximum benefit for **your specific business**. Integrating different systems and ensuring data quality requires precision. Our experience shows that close dialogue with **you as the client** and a tailored solution based on **your** specific needs are crucial for the project's success and achieving actual savings.

## Results

**Your business** gains a concrete and visual overview of its energy consumption. This often leads to:
-   **Direct cost savings** through identified inefficiencies and opportunities to shift consumption to lower-cost hours.
-   **Increased control** and understanding of how **your operations** impact energy usage.
-   **Basis for informed decisions** regarding investments in energy efficiency.
-   **Reduced environmental impact** as a positive side effect of lower energy consumption.
